We enjoyed the snug fit of this Nike pair, as its lightweight design and fantastic traction helped us with faster moves (like back-door cuts, for example).

Jordan,Luka 3,https://runrepeat.com/jordan-luka-3,,"Aug 7, 2024",Basketball,90.0,"Our verdict: The Luka 3 is here to turn the hoopers' world upside down. Its flexible and accommodating structure breaks with the past stiffer versions, providing smooth transitions and movements that require constant bending of the ball of the foot (like pretty much any kind of fake, for example). It features an IsoPlate and heavily padded interiors that add up to the tough upper material to offer wonderful foot lockdown and containment. But our favorite part was the otherworldly traction the Luka 3 offered during our wear tests, outdoors and indoors. It bit the floor like no other shoe, which encouraged us to try more daring moves also thanks to its supportive and stable structure.

We loved the way its wavy outsole bit the floor, winning the traction fight even against dusty courts. Last but not least, the KD 17's lateral guard for toe-dragging moves allows it to have a mesh upper that increases airflow, making it wonderful to play when temperatures go up.

Reebok,Answer Dmx,https://runrepeat.com/reebok-answer-dmx,,"Nov 6, 2023",Basketball,90.0,"Our verdict: We were thrilled about the comeback of the Answer DMX, with all its updates and familiar features. This Reebok Classics shoe carries a vivid 90's vibe and pays tribute to the great Allen Iverson. Even though we didn't find the same funky DMX air technology of the old, this shoe still surprised us with excellent impact protection.

Jordan,Zion 3,https://runrepeat.com/jordan-zion-3,,"Aug 21, 2024",Basketball,71.0,"Our verdict: The Zions are back and ready to absolutely break with everything you had seen before in their line! This third iteration features a reinforced and durable upper that offers a snug fit and a wonderful lockdown feel. This surefootedness also comes from all the padding it has, as well as from its magnificent ankle support. Our surprise when we were testing this Jordan pair was not only the sole flare in the forefoot, but also in the midfoot! We felt incredibly stable when we landed, and the big Zoom Air unit located in the ball of the foot provided us with some bounce every time we went for a quick move. The only drawback here is that such a close-to-the-foot structure and solid upper mean that wide-foot hoopers will most likely feel uncomfortable and cramped in the Zion 3.",,,,,,,"Pretty good traction on any court, Very reinforced and durable upper, Formula 23 foam with some bounce, Wonderful side-to-side stability, Snug fit with padded interiors, Very comfortable, Incredible lockdown feel, Smooth and easy transitions, Great ankle support","Not for wide feet, No toedrag protection, Upper doesn't give in",25.7,15.5,10.2,19.0,,,20.8,Half size small,24.8,2.0,3.0,110.0,80.0,,,13.51,383.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,77.1,0.4,3.2,$140,No,6.9,,,Yes,,,,,,,,17.6,94.4,70.6

This shoe worked wonders when we were in a triple threat position or when we tried any related moves. If you are more of an offensive player or go for that post up plays, we totally recommend it.

We felt confident and safe during our games, as its tight structure and triple top eyelet made sure our feet didn't move.

In fact, we claim it to be one of the most supportive shoes on our list! Bigger players who rely on lots of stability and impact protection (like LaMelo Ball himself) are the shoe's target audience.

Reebok,Answer Iv,https://runrepeat.com/reebok-answer-iv,,"Nov 10, 2023",Basketball,88.0,"Our verdict: The Reebok Answer IV is a standout retro model that honors Allen Iverson. For us, this shoe is a no-brainer, especially since we are suckers for classic leather silhouettes that are immensely durable and supportive. Even though this Reebok shoe falls short of proper cushioning and other features of a high-performance hoop shoe, it still performs decent on the court. But if you consider it for your casual sneaker collection, we think that the Answer IV is a fantastic offering with a rich background.",,,,,,,"Iconic '90s silhouette, Stunning leather quality, Exceptional stability and support, Phenomenal lockdown (laces, zipper, velcro), Lighter than other Reebok classics, Great forefoot traction, Cool reflective side panels","No breathability at all, Unsatisfactory cushioning, Tapered toebox",32.2,19.1,13.1,22.6,,,4.4,Slightly small,,5.0,3.0,117.0,89.7,,,15.06,427.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,64.5,2.3,6.9,$170,Yes,7.5,,Finger loop,Yes,,,,,32.0,,,55.6,108.2,72.3

This unassuming kick is lighter and more pliable than the average hoop shoe and is more about freedom of movement than it is about support. As long as you don't expect maximum impact protection and stability, you will enjoy this affordable New Balance offering.",,,,,,,"Lighter than average, Feels nimble on foot, Excellent ground feel, Responsive cushioning, Surprisingly stable, Grip is fine after a warm-up, Great durability for indoor courts","Not breathable at all, Not for outdoor play, Possible heel slippage (fixed by using the extra eyelet)",26.1,21.4,4.7,25.0,,,4.8,Slightly small,,4.0,3.0,118.1,91.1,,,12.91,366.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,75.6,1.4,5.6,$110,No,7.0,Bootie,,Yes,,,,,25.0,,,29.5,97.3,79.2
Puma,Trc Blaze Court,https://runrepeat.com/puma-trc-blaze-court,,"Aug 15, 2023",Basketball,71.0,"Our verdict: The best way we can describe the PUMA TRC Blaze Court is it's like a friend who looks small and fragile but is actually a skilled fighter. This shoe's very unassuming slender build and very minimal looks actually hide tremendous potential. We find it a pleasure to play in, and we think this is best for athletes who like to explosively sprint their way to the basket. If it wasn't for its frail outsole and upper, the TRC Blaze Court would've made it to our top charts.",,,,,,,"Excellent grip for quick movements, Incredible bounce and impact protection, Amazing in-shoe comfort, Dependable foot containment, Smooth ride, True-to-size fit, Pretty light, Slender appearance","Cheap materials and poor durability, Dulled by dust, Reduced court feel, Lacks breathability",29.0,20.1,8.9,32.0,,,4.7,Slightly small,,4.0,4.0,111.4,90.4,,,13.12,372.0,2.0,,1.0,69.4,,5.8,$120,No,12.9,Both sides (semi),,Yes,Medium,Normal,Normal,,,,,31.2,95.7,76.4

These Jordan kicks offered a super plush feel and padded interiors that made us play comfortably, which contributed to their snug fit. It also features big lateral rubberized walls and a TPU heel cage that didn't let our feet move from their right place during our wear tests. The best part is that all these reinforcements come in a breathable and flexible structure, which makes this shoe incredibly versatile. Nevertheless, all this padding and supportive features have made this shoe heavy.

Jordan,Zion 2,https://runrepeat.com/jordan-zion-2,,"Aug 7, 2022",Basketball,90.0,"Our verdict: Zion Williamson is a really big and powerful player, and his second signature shoe is perfect for players like him. We discovered that its design and overall structure contain so much force and high levels of aggression on the court.
